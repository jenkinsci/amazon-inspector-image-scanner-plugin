<div title="Help for feature: Enable Security Assessment Features">
    <p>
        Enables vulnerability thresholds, EPSS assessment, and CVE ignore functionality for comprehensive security evaluation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Vulnerability Thresholds:</strong> Specifies whether scanned vulnerabilities exceeding a value will cause a build failure.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>EPSS Assessment:</strong> EPSS scores range from 0-1, enter a value between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.6).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Ignore CVE:</strong> Specify CVEs to exclude from threshold calculations and EPSS assessment. Ignored CVEs appear in reports but won't cause build failures.
