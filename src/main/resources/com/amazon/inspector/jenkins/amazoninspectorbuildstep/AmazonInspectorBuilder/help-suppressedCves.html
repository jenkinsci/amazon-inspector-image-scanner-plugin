    <h4>CVE suppression list</h4>
    <p>
        Specify a list of CVE identifiers to exclude from vulnerability threshold calculations and EPSS assessment. 
        These CVEs will be detected and reported but will not contribute to build failure decisions.
    </p>
    
    <h5>Supported Formats:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Comma-separated:</strong> CVE-2023-1234, CVE-2023-5678, CVE-2024-0001</li>
        <li><strong>One per line:</strong><br/>
            CVE-2023-1234<br/>
            CVE-2023-5678<br/>
            CVE-2024-0001
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mixed format:</strong> CVE-2023-1234, CVE-2023-5678<br/>CVE-2024-0001</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>Behavior:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Suppressed CVEs are subtracted from vulnerability threshold counts</li>
        <li>Suppressed CVEs are excluded from EPSS threshold evaluation</li>
        <li>CVEs will still appear in scan reports and artifacts</li>
        <li>Detailed logging shows which CVEs were suppressed and their impact</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> CVE IDs must follow the format CVE-YYYY-NNNN (e.g., CVE-2023-1234)</p>
